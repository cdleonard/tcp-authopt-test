Tests for linux TCP Authentication Option
=========================================

Test suite is written in python3 using pytest and scapy. The test suite is
mostly self-contained as a python package.

The recommended way to run this is the included `run.sh` script as root, this
will automatically create a virtual environment with the correct dependencies
using `pip`. If not running under root it will automatically attempt to elevate
using `sudo` after the virtualenv is created.
